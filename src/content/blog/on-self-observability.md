One of the most challenging yet rewarding pursuits in life is self-attunement—to recognize your waves and ride with them, to be in touch with your emotions and how they manifest themselves in actions and decisions made.

Modern fitness technology helps us derive insights based on metrics of the body, performance, sleep, and nutrition. They certainly contribute towards our understanding of human performance.

I predict that self-observability is about to become much bigger with the advent of products like Humane AI and Friend, expanding beyond just physical fitness metrics and giving us a clearer picture of our true selves.

On top of fitness metrics, we're about to acquire the ability to ingest and analyze data we couldn't before without extensive work.

I'll call it the rise of frictionless self-observability.

Our behavioral patterns, emotional fluctuations, and cognitive states will no longer be mysteries to unravel with difficult work.

It will be passive. It will be intelligent. It will be actionable.

Auto-collection of data from different sensors and microphones will help us gather insights like never before and understand our emotional and behavioral patterns and reactions. It's the profound ability to let intelligence derive meaningful insights from scattered data about ourselves.

Insights can be in the form of correlations:

- You slept 6 hours → Mood score dropped the next day → Interaction with your friend was different than usual.

- You worked in deep focus for 2 hours → Reported high energy levels.

Perhaps, we can see some observability-as-a-service for humans in the future.
