**Greetings!**

I grew up chasing chaos in cybersecurity and participating in CTFs, breaking things apart to see how they worked. Bug bounties, exploits, late-night rabbit holes. That's where I learned to think like an engineer.

Now my focus is on building systems, products, and words that stick. From backend engineering to AI experiments, Some projects land, some don't, but I ship, learn, and move.

This site is my workspace in public: projects, essays, and half-formed thoughts.

If there’s a thread running through all of it, it’s this: I chase problems that feel alive.

**What I Care About**  
  •	Shipping over perfection.  
	•	Commit to curiosity & exploration. Own your weird little challenges.  
	•	Strength in body and mind. I train hard.
