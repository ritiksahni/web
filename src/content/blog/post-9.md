I was talking to a developer friend of mine about the direction of web3 products emerging these days.

One of the things we talked about was how people are trying to shift everything from web2 to web3 as if they're moving from one house to another. Emails on web3, stock inventory on web3, attendance system on web3. Programmers are trying to build the basic programs with a pinch of blockchain in it.

The question is if we really need the implementation of web3 in whatever we're solving.

We both agreed that "building on web3" is acting as a distraction from "we're solving a problem".

People are trying to sell their products by positioning it as "built on Web3" instead of positioning it based on how it's solving a problem.

"Web3 and blockchain is trending and since my product is built on top of it, you should use it!"

NO!

How about we focus on the underlying mechanisms, the value blockchain provides and leverage that to solve a real problem?

I'd rather build and position my own product as a problem-solver that just happens to be built on top of Web3 and uses the benefits of it to enable the solution to work out.
