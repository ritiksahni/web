The notion of creating "idea generation machines" and the supposed practice of generating endless ideas for a pursuit takes away the joy of it.

Systematizing the process of thinking generates ideas that produce a functional output at the end. That's utilitarian and out of touch from serendipity.

Conversely, serendipitous idea generation occurs when ideas are produced incidentally rather than as full-fledged objectives. Serendipitous ideas are more in touch with reality & experience rather than baseless thoughts.

Optimized idea generation processes do not encourage less-than-perfect ideas to be thought about. It always has to be high-utility, high-reward, and highly practical.

Not all great ideas are practical. The process of thinking is much bigger than trying to achieve a materialistic outcome.

Serendipity encourages ideas of all kinds to the extent that practicality stops mattering. Utility becomes a byproduct.
