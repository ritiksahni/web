I have a habit of setting wallpapers with words and sentences I care about. Not quotes by famous thinkers and philosophers but words I come up with myself and something I continue to think about.

The idea of setting such wallpapers is that it's similar to having your favourite quotes framed and hung on your wall where you could read them every time you are near it. Every time I boot up my system, I am welcomed by a static, single thought I am familiar with and it takes me on a mental route.

It's a simple thing to do. It's not a productivity hack but an interesting habit I like to engage with.

Every time there's an idea revolving around a monotonic thought, I create a wallpaper with those words and set it as my wallpaper.

My current one says "All in".
