It's interesting how when a person expresses resistance over what's normal, it's often seen as something virtuous.

A very common example is rebellion against formal education system.

"I don't need marks. It's stupid"

"Oh really? You must be thriving by focusing on something else"

The person in this scenario disliking the concept of marks may be convinced that there are things more important than marks and the other person now thinks of those contrary values as important, unusual, brave.

It probably comes from a place of acceptance that we won't be able to hold those equal values with ourselves and so we continue to think good of people who do.

In reality, it's just a mere opinion. It may or may not work for you. We compare our values to those of contrary opinions and think of them as a superior being.
