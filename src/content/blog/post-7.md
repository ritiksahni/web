My thoughts on working out of a cafe:

- It's not ideal if you're working on something that requires deep focus (like solving a hard problem)

- An experience in a cafe can be distracting enough to keep you out of achieving the flow state. 

- There's people around talking, music, cups and other noises here and there.

- It's perfect if you have some work that doesn't require a whole lot of attention and you'd always an option to order something to drink. You could be writing emails and articles, brainstorming on new ideas, reading fiction.

- Try discovering different cafes and explore the vibe across the city, you might find your perfect place. The variables to compare different cafes against include crowd, music, food, noise disturbance, accessibility, cleanliness, lighting.
