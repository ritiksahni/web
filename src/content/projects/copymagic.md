**Clipboard is a productivity bottleneck.** You copy something important, only to overwrite it with the next thing. Need that Slack link from yesterday? Gone. Want that flight confirmation you copied into WhatsApp? Good luck scrolling. Traditional clipboard managers help a little, but searching through endless lists is still a time sink.  
  
**CopyMagic fixes this.**  
  
It’s a **search engine for everything you’ve ever copied**. Type what you remember (“Slack link about SaaS growth”) and CopyMagic instantly brings it up.
  
With CopyMagic, your clipboard becomes your second brain.
