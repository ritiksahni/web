A conventional job role is nothing but an abstracted package of primal abilities.

An essayist's job is not to produce words out of thin air, it's to develop metacognitive ability at a young age and use that to observe the real world and then move his finger around a keyboard to give it a name.

A software engineer's job is not to write a Java project but to understand an abstracted system and work with it and communicate with his peers about it to make decisions around the said system.

Humans are far more adaptable than you think.

Jobs will evolve, and we'll figure it out.

The following is what you hear when one doesn't understand what work means:

AI will write essays → essayists are dead.
AI can write code → software engineering is dead.

When you mistake the tool for the craft, every new tool feels like an existential threat.

Humans have re-defined what work means every time they were given a new tool: a printing press, a smartphone, a compiler, an assembly line.

The "primal abilities" that I am referring to means pattern recognition, symbolic reasoning, empathy, abstraction, coordination with other humans.

It's the ultimate "we're a speck of dust in the universe" argument but for work culture.
