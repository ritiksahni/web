I had my accountancy exam today and this is what I was thinking...

I've written a fair bit on the importance of repetition in habit development, personality changes. In most of my previously written ideas, it was emphasized that deliberate repetition leads to changes and shifts in life trajectories over a period of time. Today, I was thinking of opportunities for creation of loops as we navigate through our lives.

Take an example lying. It's common to see people to start lying once and that continues for long.

Another one is convincing parents to travel alone, you prove once that you can travel alone and you it's easier to attain permission next time cause we get familiar with the experience of it and that loop for repetition starts.

Linking this idea to having a not-to-do list which governs your actions so you don't become what you don't want to be (the opposite of a to-do, action-list that tells you what to do in future for achieving a goal)

Having a rough idea of the direction you don't want to go to in the future is still fine. Once you know that, everytime you do something new, you'll think if it aligns with your not-to-do list or not. If it does, you avoid it and that closes the opening for a loop of repetition but in case you still choose to engage with that activity, the loop opens up and mind becomes more comfortable to do it again. Example: lying to people, taking certain risks.

The idea of this post being that it's not always through deliberate repetitions that you change the trajectory of life but instead by reflecting in real-time if creating a certain loop would be good or not, as you navigate through life.
