I've been noticing people with knowledge of dark side of human reality mistake themselves as a superior being. In a way, it's fair to say that unless you let the your knowledge of the dark conquer over the rest and distorts your view making it all nihilistic and pessimistic.

Such people preach about what could go wrong when doing something new as they're aware of the past events that must have happened.

I am too interesting in knowing what the general public does not know and what's not reflected by mainstream media houses, publishers, authors but because of the rarity of such information, we tend to overvalue its significance letting it distort our views and it makes us think as if we're a superior being now that we know some truths others generally don't.

This is a note to myself that the knowing the entire reality means knowing the harmony between the good and the bad, what's shining and what's behind the curtains, the order and chaos.
