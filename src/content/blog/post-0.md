Breath.

Pay attention to your breath.

The day's over. 

You've done a lot of thinking today. The thought of ice cream cravings during a shower, the thought of her randomly in the middle of your work bout. There were also short periods of time during your day where you didn't think hard enough. You were consumed by 60 second long reels about flowers, jokes about your families. Every new video is like a short-introduction to a new person.

"Hey, I am an Instagram video about flowers. You like flowers? Flowers are beautiful. They're red, pink, white, yellow. What do you think about flow-"

Oh, time's up. Introduction's over. But flowers were all you could think about. It wasn't as hard as thinking about what project to work on for the next 2 years or what needs to be done in your next college assignment. The world was just about flowers for 60 seconds. That's how we operate in these short bouts of time when we're not thinking hard enough.

The day's over.

Pay attention to your breath.

Breath.
