### Migrating to iOS.

Switched from an Android phone by Samsung to an iPhone 17. Working on iOS app ideas that I will be building the next couple of weeks.

Exploring B2C apps around meditation, productivity, focus.

### Training

I've lost a few kgs of weight in the last one month, working on better endurance so I can fight a boxing match soon.

Watching sparring footage in the evening as a pre-workout ritual to gear up.

Boxers to look out for:
- Roy Jones Jr.
- Lomachenko
- Floyd Mayweather Jr.
- Gervonta Davis

### AppSumo

Gearing up for an AppSumo launch for [CopyMagic](https://copymagic.app). It's still under review, expecting launch in a few weeks. The review is still pending.

### Breathing

I've been conscious of my breathing patterns and I realize that it's working against me in my athletic pursuits. Exploring Buteyko breathing.
