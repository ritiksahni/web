### Migrating to iOS.

Switched from an Android phone by Samsung to an iPhone 17. Working on iOS app ideas that I will be building the next couple of weeks.

Exploring B2C apps around meditation, productivity, focus.

### Back in the ring.

Started working on my training routine once again after a vacation so I can participate in a fight in the next couple of months.

### AppSumo

Gearing up for an AppSumo launch for [CopyMagic](https://copymagic.app). It's still under review, expecting launch in a few days.
