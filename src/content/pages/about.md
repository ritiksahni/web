**Greetings!**

I am Ritik Sahni, a 19 year old BCA undergraduate studying at the [Bangalore School of Design and Technology](https://www.bsd.edu.in/).

I have a cybersecurity background. I've spent a considerable amount of my teenage hacking around participating in bug bounty programs.

The process of hacking bring the chaos that I seek to learn from.

Since then, I've pivoted into moving my focus into developing software, writing code and bringing my ideas to reality (starting with things like a nice little [todo list](https://github.com/ritiksahni/do)).

This is where I write. This is where I express.
