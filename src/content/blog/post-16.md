A lot of people misunderstand memes for jokes. A meme can be funny and that can decide it's popularity but the underlying idea of a meme is that it contains information about culture, society, races, events, people, nature, etc.

A phrase such as "Relatable memes are funny" is used. It makes sense because we enjoy to look at our own life from a different point of view, in the form of memes. Richard Dawkins calls it self-replicating unit of information.

Memes can evolve as the society evolves and can leave imprints of the past. Memes are more than jokes. They are vessels of information about the reality that can be communicated with other humans. The dynamic nature of memes won't make it go away.

I once thought and wrote about the possibility of identifying possible future behaviour of humans by reading their culture. Connecting that idea with memes is making me question how easy that becomes through a test with series of various memes shown to people.

An interesting experiment.
