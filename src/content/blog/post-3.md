I realized I've embraced a more individualistic lifestyle in the past 1 year as compared to the previous 3-4 years.

I think of the micro-cultures I was a part of or could be a part of.

Several interests groups run over the internet and that essential shapes personality for a lot of people out there. Forums on illegal hacking, game modding, the culture of using XDA Developers and people who'd mess around with their Android phones to get something unusual out of it. Telegram groups all about pirating content still exist and so it shapes the consumer behaviour of people all around the globe when it comes to digital content and subscriptions.

Minds came together and progressed for a common goal. It wasn't for world hunger or climate change but all about the micro decisions people could make to make their lives slightly more interesting and fascinating each day.

Groups of people talking about rock bands and metal.

"They play just like Led Zeppelin"

"I don't care if they copy Led Zeppelin, they're good"

Out there in the real world you can find a similar structure in gyms where people strive for a common goal and understand one another.
