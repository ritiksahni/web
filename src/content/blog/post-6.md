People frequently manage and govern how their social circle can laugh about certain issues and concepts. It's like though communities have agreed on a mutually agreed-upon boundary, and we must adhere to it while employing humour.

I believe that humour is a means for humans to find things entertaining, and that it may bring people together on an emotional level. The notion that we must stay inside certain parameters while employing comedy restricts our ability to connect.

I'd rather prefer folks make jokes about whatever they want. Humour, in my opinion, is a tool for comprehending the depths of human reality. Imagine meeting someone for the first time and learning about their problems and sufferings; it's entirely conceivable with the use of humour. Sure, we can choose to disconnect if we don't like a certain aspect of someone, but consider humour as a way to reach that judgement where you know what it's like to be with that person.

You can use humour to test folks and find out what they're comfortable talking about. They've considered it if they can joke about it. After all, this is a game about deciphering people's thoughts. Why not use humour to accomplish this?
