We think and share examples to make it easier for the recipient to understand an idea but not all examples work well. What makes an example impactful enough that people understand the underlying idea easily?

It's relatability. Examples aren't powerful enough if we don't relate or haven't experienced the background of a particular example ourselves.

A poor example is one which is based on a theoretical hypothesis that makes sense only when you hold unrealistic assumptions.

"If you do X, Y will happen". Assuming that it's not feasible for a human being to do X, this example becomes a poor one. There isn't relatability with the assumptions held.

A good example makes use of realistic assumptions, experiences and builds a narrative on top of that. It's easy to understand and is valid when you can connect the dots of each of the events happening within.
